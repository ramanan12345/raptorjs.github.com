                The RaptorJS optimizer simplifies the development
                of web applications by relieving developers from
                worrying about and managing webpage dependencies (i.e. CSS and JavaScript resources).
                RaptorJS provides structure around dependencies by allowing every module and UI component to
                declare its own dependencies as part of a package. Each package
                provides enough information for the RaptorJS optimizer
                to optimize the delivery of webpages with little to no developer intervention.
                The webpage developer only needs to tell the optimizer which
                top-level modules, UI components and resources are required
                and the optimizer will take care of the restâ€”including generating
                the static resource bundles <i>and</i> the HTML markup to include
                the required resources in an HTML page.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike other optimizers, the RaptorJS optimizer is source-code agnostic. As a developer, you
                can write your web application code however you prefer and still
                benefit from the RaptorJS optimizer. 
                Third-party libraries can easily be utilized with no constraints, but you will most likely
                want to wrap the third-party library with one or more

            <p>
                RaptorJS is extensible and supports any type of resource as a dependency (in addition to raw JavaScript and CSS resources). 
                Out of the box, RaptorJS supports compiled resources such as <a href="${url('/raptor-templates')}">Raptor Templates</a> and 
                <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> as dependencies, but you can
                add support for your own compiled resources with just a few lines of code.
            </p>
            <p>
                Optimizing an application by changing how resources or bundled or minified
                does not require any changes to application code. The RaptorJS optimizer
                is developer-friendly by supporting multiple profiles to easily enable
                and disable optimization features such minification and bundling.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, the RaptorJS optimizer is aware of "package extensions" which allow
                pages to be optimized differently based on the target environment.
                This allows developers to design web applications that adapt to the target
                client and only send the code that is required.

        <docs:section heading="Page Dependencies">
            <p>
                Complex pages will often depend on a lot of JavaScript and
                CSS resources and those dependencies often change over time.
                RaptorJS supports the concept of <i>"package everything"</i>.
                This includes creating a package for a page that describes
                all of the top-level dependencies for a page. The page package
                can add dependencies for other module packages. The same package.json
                file is used to declare packages for pages, modules, UI components, etc.
            </p>
            
            <docs:section heading="Declaring Page Dependencies">
                <p>
                    The modules and resources that a page depends on should be 
                    declared in the page's <code>package.json</code> file. A
                    sample <code>package.json</code> file is shown below:
                </p>
<docs:code-editor 
    mode="javascript"
    readOnly="true" 
    c:parseBodyText="false"

    "includes": [
        {"module": "widgets"},
        {"module": "pubsub"},
        {"module": "components/buttons/Button"},
        "page.js",
        "page.css"
    ]
}]]></docs:code-editor>
                <p>
                    The above <code>package.json</code> file declares
                    that a page depends on three modules (i.e., widgets, pubsub and widgets).
                    Each of those modules will have a <code>package.json</code>
                    files that describes the dependencies for each. The <code>package.json</code>
                    file also declares that two resources should be sent to the browser 
                    (i.e. "page.js" and page.css). A page's <code>package.json</code> file
                    provides enough information for the RaptorJS optimizer
                    to be able to know how to generate the resources are
                    required for the page to function in a browser. The next few
                    sections describes how the required resources are injected into a webpage.

            <docs:section heading="Resource Slots">
                <p>
                    An HTML page that is sent to the browser will need to
                    include <code>${entity:lt}script></code> and <code>${entity:lt}link></code>
                    tags that link to the required resources for the page to function
                    correctly.
                    The RaptorJS optimizer allows resources to be targeted for any location
                    on a page through the use of "slots". Slot markers can be added
                    to an HTML page and resources can be targeted for any available user-defined slot.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    For performance reasons, <code>${entity:lt}link></code> tags
                    for CSS resources are typically inserted into the <code>${entity:lt}head></code>
                    tag of a page (we'll call this the "head" slot) 
                    while <code>${entity:lt}script></code> tags for JavaScript resources are typically
                    inserted just before the closing <code>${entity:lt}body></code> tag (we'll call this the "body" slot). 
                    By default, CSS resources are injected into the "head" slot and JavaScript
                    resources are injected into the "body" slot.
                     
                    
                    go into and developers can add as many slots as they would
                    like to an HTML page.

                    <p>
                        The JavaScript API for the RaptorJS provides a method for retrieving
                        the HTML markup for slots. For example:

                        A developer can override which slot

                The configuration for the RaptorJS optimizer is driven
                by a simple, but powerful <code>optimizer-config.xml</code>
                file that will typically be placed in the root of a

                so that the page can be optimized differently
                based on which profile is enabled. For example,
                to improve developer productivity, bundling of resources
                and resource minification can be disabled.
