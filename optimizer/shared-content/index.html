<div class="section section-level-0"><h2 id="Resource_Slotting">Resource Slotting</h2><div class="bd"><p>The RaptorJS Optimizer allows resources to be targeted to specific locations on
HTML page by assigning "slot" names to resource includes. A slot is just a
unique name that should correspond to a location on an HTML page. An
application can make use of as many resource slots that it needs. By default,
all CSS resources will be targeted for a slot named "head" and all JavaScript
resources will be targeted for a slot named "body". The following example
illustrates how to retarget a resource for a custom slot for a resource
included inside a
<code>package.json</code> file:</p><div class="code-editor" id="s802"> <textarea id="s802-textarea" style="display: none;" name="code-71">{
    "raptor": {
        "dependencies": [
            ...
            { "path": "my-widget.js", "slot": "my-custom-slot" }
            ...
        ]
    }
}</textarea></div></div></div>
